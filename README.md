# Spam email detection using ML

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). By utilizing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction technique and logistic regression as the classification algorithm, this project endeavors to create an efficient and accurate spam filter. The model classifies emails with an accuracy close to 96%.
