# Spam-email-detection
## This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). By utilizing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction technique and logistic regression as the classification algorithm, this project endeavors to create an efficient and accurate spam filter.
